`picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_f6c48608}`
## Tab, Tab, Attack
unzip, find the file, strings and grep for picoCTF
`picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_76266e38}`
## Magikarp Ground Mission
ssh into the server to get `picoCTF{xxsh_` following the isntructions and following the instructions (cd /) the next part `0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_`.following the next set of directions, (cd ~) to get `c1754242}`
`picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_c1754242}`

```
`picoCTF{picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_3214be47}`
## strings it
strings it and grep for picoCTF
`picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23} `
## Bases

## Codebook
download in same directry it should do so automatically
```
$ python3 code.py
```
`picoCTF{c0d3b00k_455157_197a982c}`
## chrono 
instead of doing the crontab stuff you can just 
```
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd challenge
$ cat metadata.json
```
to get the flag
`picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_9d5cb744}`
## money-ware
google it
picoCTF{Petya}
## Permissions 
also instead of actually doing it you can use the same solution as chrono
`picoCTF{uS1ng_v1m_3dit0r_89e9cf1a}`
## repetitions
plug it through base64 a lot
`picoCTF{base64_n3st3d_dic0d!n8_d0wnl04d3d_de523f49}`
## useless
the challenge tags include the command "man"
```
$ man useless
```
`picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_4373}`
## Special
experimenting around shows that 
` ``ls`` ``-a`` ` works as a command, revealing "blargh"
` ``cat`` ``blargh`` ` shows its a directory, but when i try to cd in it refuses to open, so ` ``ls`` ``blargh/`` ` reveals a flag.txt.
```
``cat`` ``blargh/flag.txt``
```
