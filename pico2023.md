# Web
## findme
Using burp you can see the urls "//next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs" and "/next-page/id=bF90aGVfd2F5XzI1YmJhZTlhfQ==."
decrypting cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2FsbF90aGVfd2F5XzI1YmJhZTlhfQ== through base 64 gives `picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_25bbae9a}`
## MatchTheRegex
Viewing the source you can see it is checking that the input matches "p.....F"
entering any value that matches the format gives picoCTF{succ3ssfully_matchtheregex_8ad436ed}
## SOAP 
When viewing the sources, the index has an interesting line
`<form class="detailForm" action="/data" method="POST">`
This shows a POST request to the location /data. Using burp's interceptor, you can write a xml POST request to /data to get <img width="1042" alt="image" src="https://github.com/emilyh1013/writeups/assets/138421980/3fb1a6eb-725a-4af2-bce3-738fc1211fa9">
flag : `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_4dbeb2ed}`
## More SQLi
I first entered ' and ' as the user and pw to find an error. Because an error occured, its confirmed there is a SQL injection possible. By entering a common phrase into the password `'or 1=1;-- ` to get into the database. Using 
```
' UNION SELECT sql,flag,null FROM sqlite_master;--
```
 <img width="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/emilyh1013/writeups/assets/138421980/364b31be-f37a-44bb-a031-b81bbbb7a86a">

finally by selecting flag from more_table, 
```
' UNION SELECT flag,null,null FROM more_table;--
```
I get `picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_c8ee9477}.`

It's obvious the book we want is the Flag book. To elevate our status, I looked at the HTTP history requests on burp and saw they were using tokens to validate the login. looking at the structure, several files look promising. 
# Cryptography
## HideToSee
Using futureboy to extract the jpg through the Prompt to save method, you get `krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_05y2z65z}.` putting that through an atbash decipher gives `picoCTF{atbash_crack_05b2a65a}`
## ReadMyCert
decrypting through base64 gives `picoCTF{read_mycert_373b4ab0}`
## rotation
Putting it in a rot decipher shows that it was rotaed 8 characters in the alphabet. `	picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_7d140864}`
## RSA
Inspecting the source code shows the challenge uses a RSA encryption system. the pow function computes the anger value, resulting in the encryption of pride, the plaintext. 
to reverse the encryption process you can write a script that brute forces the p and q values as long as ed-1 doesn't have a ridiculous number of divisors by checking for primes with 128 bits. Once you get the p and q values, multiply them to get the n modulus, evaluate phi(n) with (p-1)(q-1), then compute d with the `Crypto.Util.number.inverse` function. decrypting the ciphertext with `m = pow(c, d, n)` gave `picoCTF{7h053_51n5_4r3_n0_m0r3_3858bd66}`

Literally anything works
`picoCTF{h3r0_t0_z3r0_4m1r1gh7_e476d4cf}`
## Reverse
```
strings ret | grep picoCTF
```
`picoCTF{3lf_r3v3r5ing_succe55ful_c83965de}`
## Safe Opener 2
```
strings SafeOpener.class | grep picoCTF
```
`picoCTF{SAf3_0p3n3rr_y0u_solv3d_it_7db9fb8c}`
## timer
decompiling and grepping for the flag reveals its in BuildConfig.java `picoCTF{t1m3r_r3v3rs3d_succ355fully_17496}`

almost any corewars code on the internet, or same solution as gladiator 2.

# Forensics
## hideme
binwalk shows a hidden secret/flag.png
```
binwalk -e flag.png
```
opening the flag.png in the extracted directory gives an image which you can convert to text to get `picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_within_@n_ima9e_ad9f6587}`
## PcapPoisoning
kind of cheating but if you choose to open with word/notepad or any other text editor you can control f picoCTF to get `picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_fc4e803f}`
Setting a display filter for a picoCTF string is another option on wireshark
## who is it
viewing the full header of the gmail gives you the ip adress `173.249.33.206`
using an IP adress finder gives the person's name `picoCTF{WilhelmZwalina}`
## FindAndOpen
Looking through the packets on wireshark reveals a base 64 string <img width="1115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/emilyh1013/writeups/assets/138421980/13870da5-dfa3-4d9b-911e-ab9968c455eb">
decoding the string gives `picoCTF{R34DING_LOKd_`
using that as the password opens the file, `picoCTF{R34DING_LOKd_fil56_succ3ss_c2e6d949}`
## MSB
downloading and uploading the image to stegonline extracts the data with these settings
